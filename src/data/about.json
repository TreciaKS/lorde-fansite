  "description": "Perhaps being different is the new cool, or Lorde made it so. I am Trecia, a huge fan of Lorde. The first Lorde song I was exposed to was the popular 'Royals', you know, 'let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B'. I love how Lorde's music is so her and how I find myself relating to her view of the world and of life. She definitely rules my world of music and what a time to be alive! ",

  "favouriteTrackDescription": "The one track I never knew existed. When I say I searched for this track, I mean I tracked it down. I am someone who likes to google unreleased tracks or demos or ideas by almost all my favourite artists and was I happy when this song finally became available on Spotify. It's so fast paced, pop rap, perhaps? The beat is catchy, upbeat, summer vibes and really, just a great tune!",
