  "description": "Perhaps being different is the new cool, or Lorde made it so. I am Trecia, a huge fan of Lorde. The first Lorde song I was exposed to was the popular 'Royals', you know, 'let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B'. I love how Lorde's music is so her and how I find myself relating to her view of the world and of life. She definitely rules my world of music and what a time to be alive! ",

  "favouriteTrackDescription": "I don't really know how to express my love for this song. The lyrics are captivating and focusing on real world issues (not that I care about what's happening around the world). The poetry and flow coming from a then 16-year old Lorde is just incredible.The beat and emotion put into it really get's me into a calming state."
