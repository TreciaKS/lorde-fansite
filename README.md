# Lorde Fansite
The purpose of this project was to put my grid and flex layout, web responsiveness, UI/UX, TypeScript skills from theory into practise

And the perfect way I knew how was to build a fun project that expresses a love for thee famous singer, Lorde. 
I also aimed to practise how to integrate third party authentication tools like Auth0 and how to establish protected routes, conditionally render based on authenticated user.

But that has then been removed as it is redundant to require login for a static project as this.

Regardless, the lessons have been learned. <a href="https://lorde-fansite.vercel.app/">Check it out</a>
